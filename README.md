# Overview

A simple program to print Hello World to the user's screen. 

This program was created as a placeholder program while I experimented with using git, publishing to github, and keeping that program up-to-date by commiting changes to the repository. This is also my first exposure to the markdown language.

A demonstration of the software is [here](https://youtu.be/PsnxOFrqLHw).

# Development Environment

This program was made in VSCode with python and uploaded with git to Github. 
The video was made with Bandicam.
