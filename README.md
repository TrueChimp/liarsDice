# Overview

This program is a game that plays liar's Dice with the user. The program will make a bunch of bot players that have varying levels of risk acceptance and will call your bluff if they believe that the risk is too high. The program also has a risk calculation function that you can access inside and outside the game. This risk calculation will take into account the dice you have when you bluff.

I did this because I was playing a game of Liar's Dice with my friends and I believed that it would be a simple project. It was a little less simple than I first expected, but I'm proud of what I've got here so far, and I know kotlin now. In the future I hope to make the bot players a little smarter and lifelike, right now I think that they feel a little dead.

A demonstration of the software is [here](https://youtu.be/7YKWskzmFEsw).

# Development Environment

This program was made in Intellij IDEA with kotlin.
I then copied the code over into VScode and uploaded to github via git.
The video was made with Bandicam.
